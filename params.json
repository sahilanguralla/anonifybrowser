{"name":"Anonify Browser","tagline":"A Mozilla Firefox Add-on to hide your Firefox User Agent","body":"## Anonify Browser\r\nAnonify Browser lets you modify your browsers identity to another browser thereby hiding your browser from websites. This add-on might help you in situations where a website forces you to use a specific browser or operating system. There are about 100 OS versions/browser and about 7 Operating Systems.\r\n\r\n### How will it help ?\r\nAnonify Browser is intended to use for modifying your browser identity, technically modifying the User Agent string. But it not only hides your browser from websites but also :\r\n* Allows you to switch to a browser that a website recommends\r\n* Decreases Page Load on switching to a Smartphone User Agent.\r\n* Allows downloading of files that requires you to be using a specific OS.\r\n* Much more uses you can discover\r\n\r\n### Principle behind Anonify Browser\r\nIf you are thinking about is really happening at Back-end you might be amazed to know it is not as complex as it appears. It actually plays with a Mozilla preference - `general.useragent.override`. Whenever you select a browser, the preference is updated to corresponding user agent string\r\n\r\n### Coming Updates\r\nFuture versions may include following features :\r\n* notifications about currently active user agent\r\n* Update button to update user agent list\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is actually the first Firefox Add-on I, @coolboyssahil, have built. If anybody is interested in its development, he/she can fork my repository and work on it. Freshers in add-on development can learn much by working on it because of its simple design.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can connect with me on [facebook](http://facebook.com/coolboys.sahil).
