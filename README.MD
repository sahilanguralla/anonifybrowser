Hides your firefox from websites

Anonify Browser lets you modify your browsers identity to another browser thereby hidding your browser from websites. This add-on might help you in situations where a website forces you to use a specific browser or operating system. There are about 100 OS versions/browser and about 7 Operating Systems.

The principle behind this add-on is simple. It uses 'general.useragent.override' preference to modify your browser identity.

Next Update will allow you to update list of available user-agents.
